> **Why should merchants be allowed to manage customers via our API or dashboard?**
> Isnâ€™t it enough if our internal system manages customers behind the scenes?

Letâ€™s answer this directly with comparisons, reasons, and real-world Stripe behavior.

## âœ… Yes, Stripe Does Allow Merchants to Manage Customers

Stripe **exposes full customer management** to merchants via:

* **Dashboard**: Merchants can view, search, and update customers.
* **API**: Merchants can create, update, and delete customer records.

Example from Stripeâ€™s docs:

```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \
  -u sk_test_xxx: \
  -d email="alice@example.com" \
  -d name="Alice Smith"
```

## ðŸ’¡ Why Merchants Manage Customers via the Payment System

### 1. **Syncing Billing Records with Internal Systems**

* Merchants often maintain internal customer databases (for CRM, product access, etc.).
* They **mirror those users into the payment system** to:

  * Attach payment methods
  * Assign subscriptions
  * View invoices and payment history

ðŸ“Œ Without this feature: Merchants would have **no visibility** into how billing maps to their users.

---

### 2. **Automating Workflows**

* Many SaaS businesses **automatically create customers** via backend when a user signs up.
* They use your systemâ€™s customer management API to:

  * Create or update customers
  * Attach metadata (internal IDs, tags, preferences)
  * Manage payment profiles

ðŸ“Œ Without this: Every subscription or charge would be **anonymous** or require duplication.

---

### 3. **Support and Dispute Resolution**

* When a user contacts support, merchants want to:

  * Look up their customer profile
  * See charges, refunds, invoices
  * Take actions (like refund or cancel a subscription)

ðŸ“Œ Without this: The merchant would be blind to billing details.

---

### 4. **Multi-platform Use Cases**

* Some businesses donâ€™t have a web product or prefer not to handle billing in their own system.
* For example:

  * Mobile apps
  * No-code platforms
  * B2B APIs where backend handles everything

ðŸ“Œ These merchants need your **customer management API** directly to run billing logic.

---

### 5. **Customer-Scoped Webhooks, Risk Scores, Preferences**

* Risk detection, communication preferences, fraud rules, and tax handling are **customer-scoped** in Stripe-like systems.
* Merchants often use customer metadata to build rules or personalization.

ðŸ“Œ Without merchant-accessible customer records, these advanced features wouldnâ€™t be usable.
